EBS Automatic SnapShots
Overview

I came across with many people looking for a tool to administrate the EBS snapshots.
I found several tools in internet but they were just scripts and incomplete solutions.
Finally I decided to create a program more flexible, centralized and easy to administrate.

The main idea is to have a centralized program to rule all the EBS volumes and snapshots.
Besides yuo can  hook your code before running each snapshot and after it.
