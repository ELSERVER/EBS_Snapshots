the installation is based in an Amazon Linux AMI 2014.03.1 - ami-043a5034 (64-bit)

A) Firstly we have to install some tools using yum

# yum update

# yum install cpan

# yum install make

# yum install gcc

# yum install perl-Net-SSLeay.x86_64

 

B) Now we have to execute "cpan" It will ask you some basic question (first time it runs),c After that lets install these libraries

cpan> install Config::Tiny

cpan>force  install VM::EC2  ## Force to avoid API tests

cpan> install Params::Validate

cpan> install Date::Manip

cpan> install Date::Parse

** Some libraries take long time to install, it depends on the dependencies it needs.

If everything was OK we should see OK in "perl -c"

perl -c Backup.pl
Backup.pl syntax OK
