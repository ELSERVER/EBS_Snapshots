HOW TO USE;

you have to execute the program passing a config file,
perl Backup.pl -c /etc/myconfigfile

Config file should looks like this:

## GENERAL VALUES
[general]
## Credentials
AWSAccessKeyId=XXXXXXXXXXXXX   
SecretAccessKey=XXXXXXXXXXX    

daemon_mode=n
It means the script will run just once, it will do its job and the process will finish.
You have to add the line in crontab or run the script in a console.
daemon_mode=y
The script will run indefinitely in a "loop" checking when it is necessary to execute a new API call to create a snapshot/s

only_attached_volumes=n
This means the script only will be able to make snapshots to local (attached) volumes, if you want to create not attached volumes snapshots you have to change this parameter to 'y'

logfile=/var/log/file.log
You can set up the log file, you can use the STDOUT as well , like this logfile=STDOUT
If it is not set the default value is STDOUT

## VOLUMES

[vol-XXXXXXXX]
for each volume you have to add a tag with all the configurations, they are different for each volume

freq=1
You define a frequency in hours, minimum is 1 hour, for example create a snapshot each 3 hours.

quantity=8
The quantity, it works like a "round-robin" when it reaches the limit it will delete the oldest snapshot and create a new one.

prescript=/bin/test
You can add your own script to execute whatever you want, the only thing you have to take in account is the exit code, the program will wait for "0" to success, any other different exit code will be considered an error.
The script will be executed always before "create-snapshot" API call.

skip_if_prescript_fails=n
You can skip the snapshot creating if something were wrong in your prescript or keep like nothing happened.

protected_snapshots=snap-XXXXXX, snap-XXXXX
You can protect some snapshots putting them outside the script limit, They wont be taken in account, they wont be counted in "quantity".

postscript=/bin/test
As prescript but this will be executed after "create-snapshot" API call.

## More volumes......
[vol-XXXXXXX]
freq=2
quantity=5
prescript=/bin/test
skip_if_prescript_fails=n
protected_snapshots=snap-XXXXXX
postscript=/bin/test
